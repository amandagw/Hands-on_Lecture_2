### Pascal's Triangle
The program will generate Pascal's Triangle with given int numRows number of rows (numRows = 3, triangle will have 3 rows). In Pascal's triangle, each element is equal to the sum of the number direcly above to the right and directly above to the left. 

### Spiral Matrix
Given a matrix of size m x n, the program will return the order of elements in the matrix in spiral order. Spiral order traverses the matrix right, down, left, and then up repeatedly until all elements have been visited.  

### test_cases.java
 Contains main method wit multiple test cases to display correctness of code for both PascalsTriangle.java and SpiralMatrix.java.
